A Rust-based x86 Operating System

Introduction:

Over the next few weeks, I will be working on implementing a basic x86 kernel using Rust instead of C,
to get a grip on Rust and understand why it is becoming an increasingly popular language for low level
development. I will keep updating this README as I implement more parts of the Kernel.
